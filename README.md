# Ridge-Regression-Using-the-linear-regression-technique-.
Ridge regression from scratch of Brazile dataset


This project is to implement Linear Regression with L2-Regularization(Ridge regression) from scratch in Python.
there are three techniques are used for the optimiation of the cost function. 
1.A simple batch Gradient Descent algorithm
2. Closed form algorithm
3.MLE  algorithm

Exploratory data analysis and visualizations weren't performed as the goal was not to achieve high accuracy in predictions, but to build an algorithm from scratch and achieve comparable performance to built-in modules from sci-kit learn so as to test the correctness of the algorithm built from scratch.

The data set used is the Boston Housing data set from UCI Repository.
